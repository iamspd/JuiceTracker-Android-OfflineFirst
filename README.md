# JuiceTracker-Android-OfflineFirst
Juice Tracker is a modern, offline-first Android application built to demonstrate best practices in local data persistence with Room, a reactive UI with Jetpack Compose, and a robust MVVM + Clean Architecture. The app allows users to track juices they've consumed, with all data saved locally for a seamless offline experience.
